## Task 3: Student Feedback Survey Analysis (Python)

This repository will house my work for *Task 3* of my internship with Future Interns.
This task entailed the analysis of student feedback survey data to determine if a teacher taught a course in an effective manner. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) would be done to determine the teacher's performance by: *knowledge level*, *use of presentation*, *explanation of concepts*, *assignment difficulty*, *doubt resolution*, *course structure*, *student support*, and *course recommendation*. Recommendations would then be given to client based on insights uncovered.

## Task Overview
- **Task:** Analysis of student feedback survey data to uncover insights and profer recommendations based on survey data.
- **Dataset:** Student Feedback Survey data from Kaggle (CSV).
- **Deliverable:** Polished dataset, exploratory analysis, and recommendations.

---

## Workflow
1. **Installation of Libraries** - Intalled libraries needed for analysis.
2. **Loading data from file** - Imported the data (in .csv format).
3. **Cleaning and Transforming the data:**
   - Normalize column names
   - Rename column names to common schema
   - Coerce numeric parameters
   - Sort missing numeric parameters
   - Cleaning duplicates
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Knowledge level rating per student feedback.
   - Presentation rating per student feedback.
   - Concepts explanation per student feedback.
   - Assignment difficulty per student feedback.
   - Doubt resolution per student feedback.
   - Course structure per student feedback.
   - Student support per student feedback.
   - Course recommendation per student feedback.
5. **Recommendations** - Based on insights obtained from analysis.
6. **Export of cleaned data** - Saved cleaned dataset for reference purposes.

 ## Insights
 - The teacher has a good knowledge of the subject matter but the course could be structured in a better manner.
 - The teacher's presentation techniques, when explaining course concepts to students, could be better.
 - The teacher could also take time to explain course concepts to students to facilitate their understanding.
 - The teacher could incorporate harder assignments to students as a way to assess their learning curve and reinforce understanding.
 - The teacher takes time to understand and clarify doubts students have about course concepts but there's always room for improvement.
 - Student support by the teacher is generally fair so there is room for improvement.
