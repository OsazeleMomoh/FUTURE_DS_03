## Task 3: Student Feedback Survey Analysis (Python)

This repository will house my work for *Task 3* of my internship with Future Interns.
This task entailed the analysis of student feedback survey data to determine if a teacher taught a course in an effective manner. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) would be done to determine the teacher's performance by: *knowledge level*, *use of presentation*, *explanation of concepts*, *assignment difficulty*, *doubt resolution*, *course structure*, *student support*, and *course recommendation*. Recommendations would then be given to client based on insights uncovered.

## Task Overview
-**Task:** Analysis of student feedback survey data to uncover insights and profer recommendations based on survey data.
-**Dataset:** Student Feedback Survey data from Kaggle (CSV).
-**Deliverable:** Polished dataset, exploratory analysis, and recommendations.

## Workflow
1. **Installation of Libraries** - Intalled libraries needed for analysis.
2. **Loading the data from file** - Imported the data (in .csv format).
3. **Cleaning and Transforming the data:**
   - Normalize column names
   - Rename column names to common schema
   - Coerce numeric parameters
   - Sort missing numeric parameters
   - Cleaning duplicates
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Knowledge level rating per student feedback.
   - Presentation rating per student feedback.
   - Concepts explanation per student feedback.
   - Assignment difficulty per student feedback.
   - Doubt resolution per student feedback.
   - Course structure per student feedback.
   - Student support per student feedback.
   - Course recommendation per student feedback.
5. **Recommendations** - Based on insights obtained from analysis.
6. **Export of cleaned data** - Saved cleaned dataset for reference purposes.

## Highlights from Analysis
- Females (F) generate the most impressions (114.8M) and the most clicks (23.8k).
- Impressions are highest on Wednesdays. 
- The campaign seems to appeal to age groups 30-34 and 45-49.
- CTR varies per day, showing varying levels of engagement. CTR then declines as time goes by, showing that the campaign was losing its appeal.
- Only 2 ads from the top 10 ads by allocated total ad spend, pulled in enquiries and active users.
- Impressions with most age groups was on a high trend until 21st August, which then saw a decline. The exception was age groups 35-39, which saw a steady decline until 21st August and then tanked further.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritise advertising on high traffic days like Wednesdays. Saturdays and Thursdays are good as well.
- Adjust ad targeting strategies with gender and age distribution in mind.
- Reallocate ad spend budget on Ads that pull the most enquiries and active users.
- Keep an eye on the CTR trend to continuously optimize content and ad placement.
